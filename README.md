# Anomaly Detection using DBSCAN

This repository contains code for performing anomaly detection using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm on synthetic data generated from the make_moons dataset.

Introduction
Anomaly detection is an important task in data mining and machine learning, aimed at identifying data points that do not conform to expected patterns within a dataset. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a popular clustering algorithm that can effectively detect outliers and clusters of arbitrary shapes in data.

Requirements
To run the code in this repository, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Code Overview
The repository consists of the following main components:

Data Generation: Synthetic data is generated using the make_moons function from sklearn.datasets. This function creates two interleaving half circles, which serves as a good test case for anomaly detection algorithms.

DBSCAN Algorithm: The DBSCAN algorithm is implemented using sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN. It is configured with an epsilon (eps) parameter to define the maximum distance between points in the same neighborhood.

Anomaly Detection: After fitting the DBSCAN model to the generated data, outliers are identified as data points labeled with -1 in the labels_ attribute of the model.

Code Example
Below is a snippet from the Python script demonstrating the use of DBSCAN for anomaly detection:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import make_moons
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN

# Generate synthetic data
X1, _ = make_moons(n_samples=750, shuffle=True, noise=0.1)

# Scatter plot of data points
plt.scatter(X1[:, 0], X1[:, 1])
plt.title('Data Points')
plt.xlabel('X1')
plt.ylabel('X2')
plt.show()

# Initialize DBSCAN
dbscan = DBSCAN(eps=0.10)

# Fit DBSCAN and predict outliers
labels = dbscan.fit_predict(X1)

# Display outlier labels
print(labels)
Conclusion
DBSCAN is effective in identifying outliers and clusters in datasets with complex structures and noise. This repository provides a basic implementation of anomaly detection using DBSCAN, showcasing its application on synthetic data generated from make_moons.

For further exploration and application, feel free to modify the parameters and data generation techniques as per your specific use case.
